# Case Study 1 for Intro to DS

For this case study we were asking to analyze data from the World Bank

The original data was drawn from the following sources:

For GDP:

For educational data: 
https://d396qusza40orc.cloudfront.net/getdata%2Fdata%2FEDSTATS_Country.csv 

Then we were asked to answer the following questions using the above data: 

1) Merge the data based on the country shortcode. How many of the IDs match? 

2) Sort the data frame in ascending order by GDP (so United States is last). What is the 13th country in the resulting data frame?

3) What are the average GDP rankings for the "High income: OECD" and "High income: nonOECD" groups? 

4) Plot the GDP for all of the countries. Use ggplot2 to color your plot by Income Group.

5) Cut the GDP ranking into 5 separate quantile groups. Make a table versus Income.Group. How many countries are Lower middle income but among the 38 nations with highest GDP?

Finally we were asked to come up with a final analysis.
